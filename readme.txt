Project Name: SpaceTwitch
 
Genre: Tube-shooter
 
High Concept:
SpaceTwitch is a faithful remake of the popular 70s arcade game “Tempest”. The game combines beautiful color with amazing twitch gameplay. The player maneuvers a series of planes with his or her avatar. As the player moves from plane to plane, he or she shoots out projectiles toward enemies that are located further away. Enemy projectiles will come at the player, so he or she must avoid them at all costs. The player will be able to pickup special powerups that allow him or her to have special abilities like cloned ships, quicker shots, or more shots.
